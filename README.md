# Caged

You play as a humanoid creature in captivity and you pass your days entertaining your audience and just plain surviving. However, on one day, your caretaker has accidentally left the cage door open. This is your chance to escape! Try to make it to the top of the cage by jumping and climbing, while avoiding slipping on trash. Don’t forget to balance your stamina and keep the audience entertained at the same time. Also, watch out for those traps and falling rocks!

## Uniqueness 
There are some games about zoos and escaping zoos:
* **Can You Escape - Baby Panda** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.odd1apps.CanYouEscapeBabyPanda&hl=en This puzzle-game features a baby panda solving puzzles in a zoo and trying to escape and find their mother.
* **Ape Out** https://store.steampowered.com/app/447150/APE_OUT/ is a violent escape game featuring an ape killing their captors.

Of course there are more, but we brought these out because they have the escaping motif. Unlike these games, our game is a platformer and will, rather controversially, focus on making the player feel bad about being captured. We also use a human(oid) as the captured ‘animal’ to create more empathy towards the topic. The game will ask the question “How would you feel if you were captured and displayed in a zoo”.

Furthermore, we want the game’s artstyle to resemble a horror game. For this we have found some games that have the kind of artstyle we want to go for:
* **Playdead’s Inside**: 2D puzzle-solving platformer. https://playdead.com/games/inside/ 
* **Limbo** (similar)
